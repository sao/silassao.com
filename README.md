## My name is Silas. I'm a software engineer turned product designer, working on AI.

I was born in Hawaii and now live in the Pacific Northwest. As a lifelong learner, I'm completely self-taught. I devote my time to experimenting with emerging technologies and exploring how they shape human behavior. Being around passionate builders and makers energizes me. I have a high bar for quality and am obsessed with every detail.

Currently, you can find me leading design at IBM, working on agentic developer tools, or writing the next post for [my newsletter](http://userinference.substack.com/).
