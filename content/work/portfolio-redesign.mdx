a ground-up redesign of my personal site, moving from a simple single-page bio to a multi-page portfolio with blog, work showcase, and keyboard-driven navigation.

## design direction

the terminal aesthetic felt right — lowercase text, monospace accents, keyboard shortcuts, minimal color. it reflects how i work and think: direct, functional, focused on the content.

## technical decisions

- **next.js 16** with static export for fast, zero-js-framework pages
- **mdx** for content so posts and case studies live as files in the repo
- **shiki** via rehype-pretty-code for syntax highlighting that matches the site theme
- **keyboard navigation** — press `h`, `w`, `b`, `a` to move between pages

## what i learned

building your own site is a useful forcing function. every decision — from font choice to spacing scale — requires you to articulate what you care about and why.
