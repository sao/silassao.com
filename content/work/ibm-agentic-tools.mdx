as design lead for IBM's agentic developer tools, i'm responsible for shaping the experience of how developers interact with AI-powered autonomous coding assistants.

## the challenge

agentic AI represents a fundamental shift in how developers work. instead of writing every line of code, developers delegate tasks to autonomous agents that plan, write, test, and iterate. the design challenge is creating interfaces that build trust, maintain control, and surface the right information at the right time.

## approach

- **progressive disclosure** — showing agent reasoning without overwhelming the developer
- **trust calibration** — clear signals about what the agent is doing, why, and what it's confident about
- **seamless handoff** — making it easy to step in, adjust course, and hand back control

## impact

this work is helping define what the next generation of developer tools looks like — where the boundary between human and AI becomes a collaboration surface rather than a hard line.
