description: "first post — on building a terminal-inspired portfolio and why personal sites still matter."
---

this is the first post on my new site. i rebuilt it from scratch using next.js, mdx, and a terminal-inspired design language.

## why a personal site

in an era of social platforms, having your own corner of the internet still matters. it's a place to think, build, and share without constraints.

## the stack

this site is built with:

- **next.js 16** with static export
- **mdx** for content authoring
- **tailwind css 4** for styling
- **shiki** for syntax highlighting

here's what a code block looks like:

```typescript title="lib/content.ts"
export function getBlogPosts(): BlogPost[] {
  return readMdxFiles("blog")
    .map(({ slug, raw }) => {
      const { data, content } = matter(raw);
      return { slug, title: data.title, content };
    })
    .sort((a, b) => (a.date > b.date ? -1 : 1));
}
```

more to come.
